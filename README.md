personal final year project

The **Finish_sentiment_selection.ipynb** is the file to process the data and select entities and sentiment words, and also contain the coding of data process including getting corpus and comments transformation.

The **data_process.py** is a py document combine the data process functions in the  Finish_sentiment_selection.ipynb which is just convenient for me to run data process on the server so I did not pack the functions in this file.

The **cooccurence.ipynb** is a document to find out the context window size and get co-occurence matrix and trian the GloVe model and construction of sentiment dictionary.
